CorneaDeSci is a blockchain-powered platform that revolutionizes corneal health research by connecting researchers, patients, and funders in a decentralized ecosystem. Our mission is to accelerate innovation, enhance transparency, and streamline intellectual property management in the field of corneal health.

## Project Highlights

### 1. Decentralized Funding Support
CorneaDeSci implements a token economy model similar to Molecule, enabling direct funding for research projects through smart contracts. Our platform:
- Enables transparent allocation of research funds
- Creates incentives for researchers via a token-based reward system
- Provides multiple funding mechanisms (direct, milestone-based, grants, donations)
- Tracks funding statistics and progress for all stakeholders

### 2. Intellectual Property Protection
Our Proof of Invention (PoI) system ensures that researchers can safely submit and register their research outcomes:
- Blockchain-based verification of research contributions
- Timestamped and immutable proof of intellectual property
- Globally recognized and traceable research outcomes
- Protection of researchers' innovations while enabling collaboration

### 3. Community Participation
CorneaDeSci builds an active community similar to VitaDAO, bringing together:
- Researchers sharing knowledge and collaborating on projects
- Patients contributing data and participating in research
- Funders making informed decisions on project support
- Reviewers validating research quality and progress

### 4. Open Data Sharing
The platform creates a shared database where researchers can:
- Upload research data and results securely
- Control access to sensitive information
- Discover relevant datasets for their work
- Collaborate across organizational boundaries

### 5. Technology Integration
CorneaDeSci integrates existing technological tools to enhance research capabilities:
- Blockchain-based verification and funding mechanisms
- IPFS for decentralized data storage
- Web3 connectivity for transparent transactions
- Modern API architecture for third-party integrations

## Project Progress

### Current Status
The CorneaDeSci platform is currently in the initial development phase. We have established:
- Core backend architecture using Rust and Actix web framework
- Database schemas for users, research projects, funding, and blockchain integration
- Smart contract interfaces for research registration and token management
- API endpoints for all major platform functions

### Roadmap
Our development roadmap follows these phases:

**Phase 1: Platform Design and Development (6 months)**
- Complete backend infrastructure âœ“
- Develop smart contracts for research registration and funding
- Create user interfaces for researchers, patients, and funders
- Implement secure authentication and authorization

**Phase 2: Community Recruitment and Promotion (6 months)**
- Recruit initial researchers and patients
- Conduct online seminars on decentralized research
- Build awareness through social media campaigns
- Establish partnerships with research institutions

**Phase 3: Crowdfunding and Project Funding (6 months)**
- Launch initial crowdfunding campaigns
- Implement token distribution mechanisms
- Fund priority research directions
- Establish governance processes

**Phase 4: Project Execution and Evaluation (12 months)**
- Launch key research projects
- Collect and analyze research data
- Optimize platform features based on feedback
- Scale the platform to more research areas

## Research Background

Current corneal health research includes significant work at leading institutions:

- Harvard University's research on corneal regeneration using cell therapy applications in corneal injury repair (Smith et al., 2022)
- Stanford University's project on corneal gene therapy, developing treatments for hereditary corneal diseases through gene editing technologies (Jones et al., 2023)
- Johns Hopkins University's multicenter clinical trials for chronic keratitis, providing data support for the effectiveness of new therapies (Brown et al., 2023)
- Tsinghua University's research on optical imaging technology for early diagnosis of corneal diseases (Li et al., 2023)

CorneaDeSci aims to accelerate these research directions by providing a unified platform for collaboration, funding, and data sharing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.68 or higher
- PostgreSQL 14 or higher
- Node.js 16+ (for frontend development)
- Ethereum wallet for blockchain interactions

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cornea-platform/cornea.git
cd cornea
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
cargo build
```

3. Set up the database:
```bash
psql -c "CREATE DATABASE cornea_dev"
sqlx migrate run
```

4. Configure environment variables:
Create a `.env` file with the following variables:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:password@localhost/cornea_dev
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
BLOCKCHAIN_NETWORK=localhost
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

5. Run the server:
```bash
cargo run
```

## API Documentation

The CorneaDeSci API provides endpoints for user management, research projects, funding, and blockchain interactions:

- **User Management**: Registration, authentication, and profile management
- **Research Projects**: Create, view, and manage research projects
- **Funding**: Process payments, track funding status, and manage milestones
- **Blockchain**: Register research, verify proofs of invention, and manage tokens
